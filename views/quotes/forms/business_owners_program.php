<h2>GENERAL GUIDELINES</h2>
1.        If the risk is not categorized on the acceptable schedule it cannot be bound without prior approval.<br />
2.        No coverage may be bound in excess of that outlined in this manual without underwriting approval. Applications submitted in excess of binding authority without prior approval will be returned and risk will not be considered as bound.<br />
3.        When coverage is written, completed applications, down payment and supporting data are to be sent to the. Underwriting Office
within a reasonable period of time (no more than 5 working days after the effective date of coverage).<br />
4.        As a General Rule, no policies, binders or endorsements are to be made effective earlier than the time the order of application for insurance was made (no backdating). Special circumstances should be discussed with your Underwriter.<br />
5.        If a risk has been previously declined or cancelled by our Company or by another carrier for underwriting or non-payment of premium, the risk should be discussed with your Underwriter prior to binding any coverage.<br />
6.        Binders shall not be made effective for more than 30 days.
Any extension will require underwriting approval.<br />
7.        Binders must be submitted to our office on the day that they are issued to the insured.<br />
8.        A vacant or unoccupied risk must be reviewed with your Underwriter prior to submission. Binding authority is not granted on vacant or unoccupied risks.<br />
<strong>Note: Flat Roof - SF1 unless rubber roof than may consider SF2.</strong>
        <br />
<h2>AGENTS' UNDERWRITING RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
The underwriting of a risk begins with you, our Agent. You are responsible for the initial evaluation of the risk. Though you are not expected to deal with all of the aspects of underwriting, you should satisfy yourself that each risk you solicit meets requirements in the following:
        <br />
        <h2>MORAL CHARACTER</h2>
The greatest single factor to be considered in risk selection is the character of the prospective insured. Is he a responsible individual? Does he meet his obligations? What is his reputation?



Does he do business safely and carefully? Responsibility is a principle condition of insurance. If, after investigating, and considering the following, he finds he does not have confidence in the moral responsibility of the individual, the risk should be avoided.
<br />
(a)        Management attitude<br />
(b)        Management reputation for honesty and integrity<br />
(c)        The financial condition<br />
(d)        Type and class of employees<br />
(e)        The loss or accident record<br />

<h2>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BUILDING AND EOUIPMENT</h2>
While the age of the buildings and equipment is important, the condition and maintenance of the buildings, equipment and premises is more indicative of the general character of the risk. Important points to consider are:
(a)        Location of the Building Buildings located in generally deteriorating areas may indicate that the risk is questionable for most coverages.<br />
(b)        Housekeeping — The entire operation can often be judged by the housekeeping. Poor housekeeping may indicate a marginal or poor overall business operation.<br />
(c)        Condition and maintenance of building and equipment.<br />

<h2>OPERATIONS</h2>
Are the principals experienced in the operation? Are the employees well trained? Do the principals believe in safety and practice accident prevention throughout the operation? Is there evidence of safety practices in the form of physical safeguards? Are safety rules in writing and are they enforced?
<br />
<h2>INSURANCE HISTORY</h2>
Unfavorable insurance history as indicated by prior cancellations, non-renewal and/or poor loss experience does not conclusively indicate that a risk cannot be written. However, it is strong evidence that a very thorough investigation must be made before the coverage can be written.
Successful underwriting is based on good teamwork - with the Agent and the Company Underwriter working as a team. The Agent's team assignment is to handle the first phase of the selection process through exercise of good Agent Underwriting in the areas of Moral Character, Physical Characteristics, Operations and Insurance History. His assignment also includes the need to provide the Company Underwriter with the results of his Agent Underwriting which should include any additional information which will help you to carry out your assignment.
We need to recognize that the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Agent's</span> primary responsibility is to efficiently handle the insurance needs of the individual insured.
The <i>Company's</i> primary responsibility is to provide insurance using underwriting practices in risk selection, <span style="text-decoration: underline">acceptance and pricing which are fair to its collective</span> policyholders.
<br />
<h2>ACCEPTABILITY PREVIEW</h2>
The attached list of acceptable commercial property and liability classes outlines those risks that are generally acceptable to Community Mutual and are subject to the binding authority as outlined in your specific manual sections (SMP, Monoline Fire, BOP,
General Liability, Glass or Burglary).
<br />
Community Mutual does not write General Liability, Burglary, Glass or Inland Marine as monoline products. Those coverages are made available only as parts of our package products, SMP and BOP with binding authority as granted in your Manual.<br />
If a particular risk does not appear on our acceptable list, it does not necessary mean that Community Mutual will not consider it.
We simply do not offer you, our Agent, any binding authority.
Please consult with your Underwriter on any risks you may wish to submit that do not appear on our acceptability list.
<br />
<h2>AGENT’S BINDING AUTHORITY - COMMERCIAL LINES</h2>
All Agents, unless subject to a special agreement, are granted binding authority subject to the limits outlined in the following pages. Applications must be submitted to the company with-in 5 days of the effective date of the policy.
